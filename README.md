## QuickWeather

QuickWeather is a lightweight and mobile-friendly weather page.  It utilizes Dark Sky's REST API to get a 48-hour forecast for today and tomorrow, as well as a 7-day forecast.  This page is coded with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (utilizing JQuery, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome as well).

## Motivation

QuickWeather exists to solve the problem of the cluttered weather applications which are sometimes oversaturated with information.  It is ideal for the user who just wants a simple overview of the forecast.  "Is it going to rain today?", "What time will it start/end raining?", and "Will it be hot and sunny this weekend?" are all questions that can easily be answered with a glance at QuickWeather.

## Why use QuickWeather?

QuickWeather is smart!  It uses HTML5 Geolocation to detect an extremely precise location.  Often times, a user's generated weather forecast on QuickWeather will be precise down to their exact address, or within a few houses of precision.  If location services are disabled, or the user does not want to enable it on their device, a location can be entered into the search box.  This location lookup box uses Google's Maps API.  In this search box, a user can type a country name, a state name, a city name, a neighborhood, a street name, or even an exact address, which really lets the user dial in the precision.
